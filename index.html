     <h2> Artist Statement </h2> 
     
  <p> This is my submission for Assignment 6 where I decided to come up with a branding project for a fiction music production studio. When I was trying to come up with what I wanted to make for this project, I was having a hard time deciding on whether I wanted to code something or just design a set of art pieces that included glitch art. It wasn’t until Prof. Perry had brought up the idea of making this project a branding project for myself. That way I would have an easier time envisioning a purpose for the project, and how it would stand on its own. 
<br>
    <br>
I designed a set of 10 posters that would work alone and together. They are to promote a hypothetical music production studio, and maybe even their music streaming application. Each poster depicts a real artist with their own specific genre of music. I wanted to also implement their lyrics and “vibe” that their music gives me with a certain color. I was inspired by Apple advertisements I’ve seen in the past where they would have the artists and their songs in the commercial and in the end a sentence on the screen would appear, “Listen to Doja Cat on Apple Music”. So I tried to replicate that but with a 2000’s cyber twist that shows in the typeface and in the way I edited the photos. I was also inspired by a glitch artist on Instagram named “lanceweiler” who worked with a lot of halftones in their glitch work.
